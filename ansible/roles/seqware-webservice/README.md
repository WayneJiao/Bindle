SeqWare Webservice Role
-----------------------

This sets up tomcat with the two SeqWare tomcat-compatible webapps, the Portal and the Webservice. Note that it also populates the database with example data. 

This should probably be refactored to allow this to run on a separate node from master or the database server at some point.
